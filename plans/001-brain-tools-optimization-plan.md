# Brain Tools Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize the Brain tools in the Human MCP project following Anthropic's best practices for writing tools for agents and incorporating patterns from successful MCP server implementations (Sequential Thinking and Memory servers).

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified

1. **Overly Complex Input Schemas**: Current Brain tools have 10-15 optional parameters each, making them difficult to use effectively
2. **External API Dependency**: All reasoning is dependent on Google Gemini API, creating latency and cost overhead
3. **Verbose Tool Descriptions**: Tool descriptions are too detailed and technical rather than action-oriented
4. **Monolithic Tool Design**: Each tool tries to do too much instead of focusing on a single purpose
5. **Missing Memory Capability**: No persistent context storage between reasoning sessions
6. **Inefficient Token Usage**: Complex parameter schemas and verbose outputs consume excessive tokens

### Strengths to Preserve

1. Sophisticated reasoning capabilities with multiple thinking styles
2. Hypothesis testing and validation features
3. Confidence scoring and evidence tracking
4. Meta-cognitive reflection capabilities
5. Well-structured processor architecture

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Simplify tool interfaces while maintaining core functionality
2. Implement native MCP reasoning for basic operations
3. Add memory/knowledge graph capability for context persistence
4. Optimize for token efficiency and clarity
5. Follow Anthropic's best practices for tool design
6. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Reduce API calls to Gemini by 50% for basic reasoning tasks
2. Improve tool discovery and usability for AI agents
3. Decrease average response time by 30%
4. Maintain or improve reasoning quality
5. Support incremental migration from current implementation

## Architecture

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Refactor Existing Tools (Incremental)

**Description**: Progressively refactor existing Brain tools to follow best practices while maintaining Gemini integration.

#### Pros
- Lower risk, incremental changes
- Maintains all existing capabilities
- Easier testing and rollback
- No breaking changes for current users
- Can be done in phases

#### Cons
- Still dependent on Gemini API for all operations
- Limited improvement in response time
- May not fully address token efficiency issues
- Retains some complexity

#### Implementation Steps
1. Simplify input schemas to 3-5 essential parameters
2. Rewrite tool descriptions to be concise and action-oriented
3. Split complex tools into focused, single-purpose tools
4. Implement response caching for common queries
5. Add output format options (summary, detailed, raw)
6. Optimize Gemini prompts for efficiency

### Approach 2: Hybrid Native/Enhanced System (Recommended)

**Description**: Create a dual-layer system with native MCP tools for basic reasoning and Gemini-powered tools for advanced analysis.

#### Pros
- Reduces API dependency by 60-70%
- Faster response for common operations
- Better token efficiency
- Follows MCP best practices
- Enables offline/local reasoning
- Cost-effective for high-volume usage

#### Cons
- More complex implementation
- Requires careful routing logic
- Two systems to maintain
- Initial development overhead

#### Implementation Steps
1. Implement native Sequential Thinking tool (no API calls)
2. Create Memory/Knowledge Graph system
3. Build simple reasoning tool for basic logic
4. Refactor Gemini tools for specialized tasks only
5. Add intelligent routing to choose appropriate processor
6. Implement unified response formatting

## Recommended Approach

**Approach 2 (Hybrid Native/Enhanced System)** is recommended because:
- Aligns with Anthropic's best practices of tool simplicity
- Reduces operational costs and latency
- Provides flexibility for different use cases
- Enables progressive enhancement
- Better suited for high-frequency reasoning tasks
